> Transparent JavaScript code coverage inside a ServiceWorker

**Why is this utility called Tehran?**

The best JavaScript code coverage library is called [istanbul][istanbul], and it is
named after a city in the country famous for its rugs. Tehran is the capital of another
country famous for its carpets ;)

[istanbul]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/istanbul
